## TITLE: ADR 001 - Type of application

## Prologue (Summary)

The app will be used the people that are powershell users and wants their profile shared.

In the context of 

Use Case 1 : No Authentication , upload 

and 

Use case 3:  User can see data for a user name

the decision an WebSite. In order to achieve Use Case 1 from powershell, an WebAPI should be implemented.



## Discussion (Context)

From WebAPI we can decouple the GUI(SPA) from the WebAPI - and maybe modifying / trying different  GUIs ( Angular, React, MVC)

## Solution

It is the common way those days to split the app in BackEnd and FrontEnd.

## Consequences

We have the possibility to upgrade separately the BackEnd and FrontEnd.

However, it will be more difficult to debug the SPA.
