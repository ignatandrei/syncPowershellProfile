## TITLE: ADR 005 - Logging

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Andrei Ignat

Technical Story: Must add some logging library in order to debug problems

## Context and Problem Statement

Every time there is a problem, logging could solve the problems by having more details about what is wrong

So I MUST add logging


## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Making one library for logging is not so complicated , however 
  * the exporters to other systems are cumbersome and difficult
  * also threading is a problem when writing to a file
* There are already production battle tested libraries that performs the work well.


## Considered Options

* NLog , https://nlog-project.org/
* Serilog , https://serilog.net/
* Others ( log4net )
  

## Decision Outcome

Choosing *NLog* because it is simpler to configure from a text file


### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

Devops should be happy - the logging file for production could be also put into SourceControl without problems.

### Negative Consequences 

Do not support yet SAMNE logging for a class. Could be alleviated by having DebuggerDisplayAttribute for the class and logging the function

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Serilog

* Good, because Widely adopted
* Good, because A lot of documentation
* Good, because Great community
* Bad, because A bit harder to learn when coming from log4net

### NLOG

Advantages

* Good, because A lot of documentation
* Good, because Having been around a long time, there are lots of blog posts
* Good, because Easy to get started when coming from other logging frameworks
* Bad, because Structured logging is still a bit behind Serilog
* Bad, because C#-based API is harder to use than Serilog's fluent API
