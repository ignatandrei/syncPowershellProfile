## TITLE: ADR 004 - Database


## Issue

Saving and Retrieving the data means a form of database - relational, not relational, file storage ... 

## Decision

Relational Database  for server -  SqlServer 
If we want to test on client - Sqlite

## Status

- Approved

## Grouping

    Database


## Assumptions

The retrieval of data should be somehow fast - like maximum 15 seconds for any 4 MB of content ( does not account data transfer )

Also  , should account ( see Case 003 )to get PC Names for a User .

## Constraints

Testing Data should have also a database ( UAT )

## Positions

Could also be 
- a non-relational database ( Mongo DB)
- other relational ( PostGreSql)
- file based systems

## Argument

I know very well  SqlServer .

For non -relational - it will load all the data in order to find PC names for an user ( ok, maybe with caching will do )



## Implications

More time to install the app remote (because of SqlServer)
