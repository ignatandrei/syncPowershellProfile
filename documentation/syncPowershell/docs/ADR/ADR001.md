## TITLE: ADR 001 - Engine for documentation

### Status : accepted
<!--truncate-->
### Context 

Need to have a static documentation site with blog also .

In those days there are many engines on the market. And I can built one ;-) .

Read https://docusaurus.io/docs#comparison-with-other-tools . The only that seems to fit the bill are REACT based - I cannot afford learning VUE after Angular and React.

The problem with REACT is that he is going also to server side ... 

### Decision

Docusaurus it is because 

1. Apparently is it the best on REACT
2. I know REACT 
3. It has BLOG and Documentation

### Consequences

The build process  will be somehow different.

Could be hard to transfer what I have written to another engine


### ADR based on
