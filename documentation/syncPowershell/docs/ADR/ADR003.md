## TITLE: ADR 003 - Tests

### Submitters

- Andrei Ignat


## Change Log

- [Approved](https://github.com/ignatandrei/syncPowershellProfile/pull/4) 2023-08-24
- [Modified](https://github.com/ignatandrei/syncPowershellProfile/pull/6) 2023-08-28


## Referenced Use Case(s)

All use cases, e.g. 

- UseCases001 - No Authentication , upload


must be enforced via an automated  Test.

## Context

The tests are an important part of the software - so the framework that I am using is important.

Also , the organization of the software must allow testing business rules more than endpoints / GUI that are changing very often.

Also, the code coverage is pretty important - should be at least 80%

## Proposed Design

Every GUI application ( Desktop,Console, WebAPI ) must be skinny - i.e. passing data to a business component.

Also, Business should not call static functions ( e.g. DateTime.Now, Environment.CurrentUser) but pass interfaces or functions in order to be Mocked.


## Considerations

Testing GUI's / endpoints should be make at least possible in the developing of the app, because they are changing fast.


## Decision

As frameworks we will have :

XUnit ( preferable constructor over \[SetUp\] ) - see https://testsigma.com/blog/nunit-vs-xunit/

FluentAssertion - to improve running and debugging

LightBDD - to display  tests in a good form

<del>NSubstitute - instead of Moq -  see https://github.com/moq/moq/issues/1374</del>
